# strife
A simple game framework that wraps around SDL2.

## notes
This is a work in progress and is currently being slowly worked on as my side-projects needs evolve.

### todo list

* [ ] wrap around input events: mouse, keyboard, etc.
* [ ] handle all other events
* [ ] rendering primitive shapes: lines, points, circles
* [ ] sound stuff
* [ ] optimize String rendering
* [ ] add some more default colours (see color.go)
* [ ] maybe a default font?

## example
There are some simple examples in the `example/` directory. Try them out:

	$ cd example/images
	$ go run main.go
