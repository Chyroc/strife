# strife
A simple game framework that wraps around SDL2.

## notes
This is a work in progress and is currently being slowly worked on as my side-projects needs evolve.

## example
There are some simple examples in the `example/` directory. Try them out:

	$ cd example/images
	$ go run main.go

In addition I have a small (rarely worked on) text-editor I write using the strife framework you can find [here](//github.com/felixangell/nate).
